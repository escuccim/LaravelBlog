				<p>I am a web developer with 20 years of experience. Lately I have been doing most of my work in PHP, but I programmed in
				ColdFusion for about a decade. I have also used Perl, Ruby, Python and others to a lesser extent . My preferred database 
				is MySQL but I have worked with most other major relational databases, including MS SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres, etc. 
				
				<p>I am available for contract development work.
				
				<p>I have a BA in Computer Science from Oberlin College in Oberlin, OH, USA and an MBA from Marist College in Poughkeepsie,
				NY, USA. I live in Switzerland.
					
				<p>This site is written in PHP using the Laravel Framework and Bootstrap CSS. It uses a MySQL database and runs on an 
				Ubuntu server.
